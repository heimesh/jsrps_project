# Project: Rock, paper, scissors.

This project was made to make use of JavaScript and implement manipulating the DOM using JavaScript.

It was divided into two stages: 
1. HTML/CSS
2. Setting up JavaScript logic and then manipulating DOM and refactoring the code.

Programming the logic for resetting the game + mainting a score system with a limit took most of the time as I had difficulty with the same. Changing my approach towards the solution helped me get over that obstacle. 

I learned the following:
1. Manipulating the DOM.
2. Working with multiple functions.
3. Using event listeners.
4. Working of functions as parameters.
5. How to debug a program.
6. Using arrow functions.
